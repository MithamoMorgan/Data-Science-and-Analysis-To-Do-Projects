Scrape data from Amazon, Jumia, or any other e-commerce website to create a list of all products currently offered at a discount and store them in a relational database. 

Perform EDA on the data  that you have stored in the relational database for your choice and even build a UI page where you can list these items using flask, fast api, streamlit, dash, or any other tool of your choice.Automate your data scrapers  using Apache Airflow.

### Tools, Frameworks, and Technologies: 
(i). Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy </br>
(ii). Scraping Tools: Beautiful Soup, Selenium, or Scrapy </br>
(iii). UI Tools: flask, fast api, streamlit, dash </br>
(iv). Automation Tools: Apache Airflow

 
## 3. scrap Upwork, automate the scrapper and receive emails with new job listed.
 
## 4. Analyze Kenya YouTube channels using Python and YouTube API
Create a project to analyze Kenya YouTube channels using Python and YouTube API. With the data you are requesting from the API Analyze YouTube channels in Kenya using Python. This may include video content analysis, subscriber trends, and engagement metrics.

### Tools, Frameworks, and Technologies:
(i). Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc </br>
(ii). YouTube API </br>
(iii). Requests

## 5. Crop Yield Analysis in Kenya - With Python.						
### Objectives:												
Identify factors influencing crop yields across various Kenyan regions and analyze historical data to uncover trends in crop production. </br>			
Utilize basic statistical methods to explore correlations between crop yields and factors like rainfall patterns, fertilizer application, and soil characteristics.	
### Data Source:							
Public agricultural data from Kenyan Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) or the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Cooperatives (MoALFC).
### Tools, Frameworks, and Technologies:
Data analysis software (e.g., Python with libraries like Pandas, Statsmodels) </br>
Data visualization tools (e.g., matplotlib, Seaborn)


# DATA SCIENCE:
## Project 1:
Automating Data Scrapers and Analytical Processes using Apache Airflow. </br>
### Tools, Frameworks, and Technologies: 
(i). Apache Airflow
(ii). Python
(iii). Pandas, Numpy other libraries
### Objective:
Scrap house listing data from buyrentkenya.com or any other website of your choice and automate your scripts and analytical processes using Apache Airflow or any other workflow orchestration tool. This project focuses on workflow automation and scheduling.

## Project 2:
Build a Kenya and East Africa Agricultural Data Portal to provided necessary information to advise the farmers and investors interested in Farming and Agribiz in Kenya.
### Tools, Frameworks, and Technologies:
Python, Django, Flask, Pandas, Numpy, Data Visualization libraries.
### Objective:
Develop a data portal for agricultural data in Kenya and East Africa. This involves collecting, organizing, and presenting agricultural data for analysis. (edited)

## 3. Nairobi Metropolitan House Price Prediction with Python.
Build a machine learning project to predict the house prices for different houses, plots, and land in Nairobi.
Tools, Frameworks, and Technologies: Python, OpenAI APIS, Machine Learning libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Flask, Fast API, OR Streamlit.
Objective: Predict house prices in the Nairobi Metropolitan area. This project involves machine learning and data analysis to create a predictive model. You can use data scraped from Project 1 above.
"On top of this you have to build a chatbot using Open AI APIs that engages users ang gives them all the information they need about housing in Kenya( Fine tuning Open AI gpt Model)." (edited) 

## 4. Sample Data Science Project with Sentiment Analysis using Kaggle and Flask.
Build a Data Science project to demonstrate sentiment analysis and classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Use a dataset from Kaggle, train a machine learning model, and deploy a Flask API for sentiment prediction.
Download the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews.
Data collection:
Download the training and testing data (usually in CSV format) provided by the chosen dataset.
Data Preprocessing:
Use libraries like pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and cleaning.
Load the CSV data into a pandas dataframe.
Clean the text data (reviews):
Remove punctuation and stop words.
Lowercase all text.
Consider stemming or lemmatization for better word representation.
Convert the text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. Common techniques include:
Bag-of-Words: Count occurrences of words in each review.
TF-IDF: Considers both word frequency and document frequency for weighting words.
Encode the sentiment labels (positive/negative) into numerical values (e.g., 0 for negative, 1 for positive).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:
Use libraries like scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
Choose a classification model like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Train the model on the preprocessed training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Deployment with Flask:
Install Flask using pip install Flask.
Create a Flask application with an endpoint to receive user input (movie review text) and return the predicted sentiment (positive or negative).
Define functions for data preprocessing (similar to the preprocessing step) and model loading.
In the endpoint function:
Receive user input as a string (review text).
Preprocess the text data.
Use the loaded model to predict sentiment on the preprocessed data.
Return the predicted sentiment as a string (e.g., "positive" or "negative").
Run the Flask application using flask run.
Testing the API:
Use tools like Postman or curl to send a POST request with the review text in the request body to the API endpoint and see the predicted sentiment returned as JSON.
PLEASE NOTE:
This is a basic project. Real-world projects may involve more complex preprocessing techniques and model selection.
Consider error handling and user input validation in your Flask application.
For deployment on a server, explore containerization with Docker for a production-ready environment.
